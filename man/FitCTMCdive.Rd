\title{Fits continuous-time Markov chain to dive and surface duration data}
\usage{
FitCTMCdive(forms, dat, model = "iid", print = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{forms}{a \code{list} with formulae for \code{dive} and \code{surface} variables}

\item{dat}{a \code{data.frame} with at least three columns named \code{dive} (dive durations), \code{surface} (surface durations), and \code{time} (start time of dive); all of these must be numeric.}

\item{model}{\code{"iid"} fits a CTMC where durations are independent over time, \code{"d"} fits a model where dive durations are correlated, \code{"s"} where surface durations are correlated, and \code{"ds"} fits where both dive and surface are correlated}

\item{print}{if \code{TRUE}, useful output is printed}
